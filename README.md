Hercules, based on the acronym "Hybrid Energy and Control Using Large Eddy Simulations", is an open-source tool for wind-based hybrid plant simulation in real time. Hercules is based around high fidelity wind farm flow simulations through AMR-Wind, co-simulated with a hybrid plant that includes solar, storage, and generation. The entire hybrid plant can be controlled using the Wind Hybrid Open Controller (WHOC).
