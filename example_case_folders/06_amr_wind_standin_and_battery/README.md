# Example 06: AMR Wind Standin and Battery

## Description

This example demonstrates how to use the AMR Wind Standin and Battery models in a simple case.  The AMR Wind Standin is set to use
the amr_standin_data.csv generated by the script `generate_amr_standin_data.py` in the `hercules/tools` directory.  This script is
called at the start of the bash process.

## Running

To run the example, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
bash sbatch_script.sh
```

## Notes

Make sure hercules conda or venv is activated before running the example.
