# Example 10: Heterogeneous Wind

## Description

This example runs a wind farm level power tracking controller, using FLORIS as a simulation
testbed, with heterogeneous inflow. The control algorithm is based on the A2e2g project. 
This will the closed loop power tracking controller.

```bash
bash run_script.sh
```
## Outputs

To plot the outputs run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python plot_outputs.py
