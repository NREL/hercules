This case is meant to build on example 2 with some updates:

  - Use and revise the notes in moa_python to try to get this right more smoothly
  - Follow the new practice that the case should be run out of the scratch case folder and not from within emy_python
  - Work with the newly reorganized repository


  Starting by copying in to this folder the precursor input from 005_abl_neutral_lowTI_redo, precursor_005.inp

  Next following the notes within moa_python: notes/03_setting_emu_run.txt
  (note I've already moved the necessary inputs to /projects/ssc/amr_precursors/005_abl_neutral_lowTI_redo)

  Can compare original_precursor_input to run_005 to see all these changes

  Now set up the batch script to run when run from the scratch folder I'm running out of
