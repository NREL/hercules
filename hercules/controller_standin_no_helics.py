    This class is a pass-through stand-in for a plant-level controller.
    Actual controllers should be implemented in WHOC
    (https://github.com/NREL/wind-hybrid-open-controller). However, this
    has been left in to allow users to run Hercules without plant-level
    control, if desired.

    This assumes Hercules is running with actuator disk turbine models, and
    will be updated (to be simply a pass-through) when the ROSCO/FAST turbine
    models are incorporated.
